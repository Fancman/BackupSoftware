* TODO Model improvement proposal
  - [ ] Use similar format for source as destination in backups (source drive ID
    and path), so that external drives can be also considered as sources and can
    work even when drive letter doesn't match.
  - [ ] Add field ='name' TEXT= to =drives= table (see below).
  - [ ] =drive-ksuid= should be primary key of drives (no need to have two IDs).
  - [ ] Allow more paths to be contained in one archive (m:n relation
    backup:destination).
  - [ ] Save timestamp of last backup for each individual path on each drive (so
    that user can see when was a specific path backed up on a specific drive).
** New model
  - use singular table naming -- shorter SQL statements and better for possible
    ORM (napr, drive, backup)
  - rename destinations to source (or something that better decsribes it)
  - add human-friendly name to drive
  - allow m:n relation between backup:source
  - allow m:n relation between source:drive (to know when was some path backed
    up on which drive)

  - TABLE drive:
    - PK drive_ksuid (INTEGER)
    - name (TEXT) -- this should be human-friendly name (e.g. "seagate drive")
  - TABLE archive:
    - PK id
    - name (TEXT) -- this will be used as the file name (It should probably
      include file extension that will enforce archiving/compression type (e.g.
      name="photos-2020.7z"). Otherwise we need another field with backup type.)
  - TABLE backup:
    - PK archive+drive
    - FK archive
    - FK drive    -- on which drive is the archive *stored*
    - path (TEXT) -- this should be relative path to a folder on the drive
  - TABLE source
    - PK id
    - FK archive
    - FK drive    -- *source* drive
    - path (TEXT) -- relative path to a folder/file on drive that's being backed
      up
  - TABLE timestamp
    - PK source+drive
    - FK source
    - FK drive
    - datetime (INTEGER is probably most efficient)
