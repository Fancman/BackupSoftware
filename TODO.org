* TODO Model improvement proposal
  - [ ] Use similar format for source as destination in backups (source drive ID
    and path), so that external drives can be also considered as sources and can
    work even when drive letter doesn't match.
  - [ ] Add field ='name' TEXT= to =drives= table (see below).
  - [ ] =drive-ksuid= should be primary key of drives (no need to have two IDs).
  - [ ] Allow more paths to be contained in one archive (m:n relation
    backup:destination).
  - [ ] Save timestamp of last backup for each individual path on each drive (so
    that user can see when was a specific path backed up on a specific drive).
** New model
  - use singular table naming -- shorter SQL statements and better for possible
    ORM (napr, drive, backup)
  - rename destinations to source (or something that better decsribes it)
  - add human-friendly name to drive
  - allow m:n relation between backup:source
  - allow m:n relation between source:drive (to know when was some path backed
    up on which drive)

  - TABLE drive:
    - PK drive_ksuid (INTEGER)
    - name (TEXT) -- this should be human-friendly name (e.g. "seagate drive")
  - TABLE archive:
    - PK id
    - name (TEXT) -- this will be used as the file name (It should probably
      include file extension that will enforce archiving/compression type (e.g.
      name="photos-2020.7z"). Otherwise we need another field with backup type.)
  - TABLE backup:
    - PK archive+drive
    - FK archive
    - FK drive    -- on which drive is the archive *stored*
    - path (TEXT) -- this should be relative path to a folder on the drive
  - TABLE source
    - PK id
    - FK archive
    - FK drive    -- *source* drive
    - path (TEXT) -- relative path to a folder/file on drive that's being backed
      up
  - TABLE timestamp
    - PK source+drive
    - FK source
    - FK drive
    - datetime (INTEGER is probably most efficient)
* TODO Can't distinguish destination in list-backups
  Suppose I have created two backups with same source but different destinations:
  #+begin_example
Source id: 1 - D:\Sources\base16\ [F:\test\P:\test\] - Archive name: base16.7z
Source id: 2 - D:\Sources\base16\ [F:\test\P:\test\] - Archive name: base16.7z
  #+end_example
  Which one is which?

  This is probably caused by =create-backup= not checking whether source already
  exists (there's a duplicate row in =source= table).
* TODO Fix UNIQUE constraint failed after update
  Error reads out:
  : UNIQUE constraint failed: timestamp.source_id, timestamp.drive_ksuid
  It happens after update (start-backup). Probably related to the previous TODO.
* TODO Allow user to enter multiple sources in create-backup
* TODO Allow user to enter multiple destinations in create-backup
* TODO Allow user to choose just one destination/or all of them
  when starting the backup or updating archive.
* TODO Allow user to add or remove sources/destinations in backup
  This probably needs a new command.
* TODO Show the timestamp somewhere
  Probably a switch for =list-backups=.
* TODO Allow user to enter NAME for a Drive
* TODO Implement separate update operation
  Now it's always executing /add/ operation when creating or updating the
  archive. When the archive already exists, it should run the /update/
  operation.


* TODO Make abstractions for other file formats
  .tar etc.
* TODO Add interactive mode
* TODO Create batches
  Multiple backup operations. This can be also done as a shell script.
* TODO Write tests
  DB consistency, correctness of archived/restored filesâ€¦ Maybe this should be
  higher on the priority list?
